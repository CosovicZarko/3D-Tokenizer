# 3D-Tokenizer
Given text is separated into sentences, and each sentence is turned into an array of words. Program is set to read user input from the keyboard, and the result is printed to the screen, but the code can easily be changed to read from a file, and write to a file. Reading is done character by character, into a buffer, which is then copied into the array. Words are copied exactly and then null terminated, turning a sentence into an array of strings. Finally, we make an array of these arrays of strings. This code is a part of my bash shell, which could take multiple commands.
